<h3>How It Works</h3>

<h4>1. Searching for Movies</h4>
<p>Users can search for any movie by typing its name in the search bar. The search results are fetched in real time from the IMDb API and displayed in a grid format. Each result is shown with the movie poster, title, and release year. Clicking on a movie card takes the user to the movie's detailed page.</p>

<h4>2. Viewing Movie Details</h4>
<p>On the movie details page, users can see more information about the selected movie, such as the full synopsis, release date, genre, and ratings from IMDb. This page provides all the relevant details to help users decide if they want to watch the movie.</p>

<h4>3. Real-Time Data Fetching</h4>
<p>Using the IMDb API, the app fetches real-time data about movies and shows. When users search or navigate to a movie's details page, the app makes API calls to retrieve the most current information available. This ensures that the data is always up-to-date.</p>

<h4>4. Responsive Layout</h4>
<p>The app is built with a mobile-first approach, ensuring it looks great on all screen sizes. Whether on a desktop or mobile device, the layout adjusts to provide an optimal viewing experience. This responsiveness is achieved using CSS media queries and flexible layouts.</p>
